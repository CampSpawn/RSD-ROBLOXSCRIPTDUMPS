Hello, user! Welcome to the RSD github created by CampSpawn! Here you can find archives of games you want to exploit.
For example, Lumber Tycoon 2. This game is a popular target and is great for learning about exploiting. There are multiple .rbxl files-
-you may open to find an exploit, or just looking around the dump. We archive every single version, so you can just look back and see-
-if there are any other vulnerable exploits.
